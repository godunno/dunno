Checks you have to do:

1. Do ```bundle``` works and install all gems accordingly?
2. Do ```rake db:setup``` works?
3. Do ```rake db:seed``` works?
4. After run ```foreman start``` if you go to ```http://localhost:3000``` you see something that shows the project is working?
5. Is code coverage 100%?
6. Do ```rake integrate``` works and deploys to production?
7. Do the project have Rollbar or Airbrake configured in production environment?

## Create remote git repository
